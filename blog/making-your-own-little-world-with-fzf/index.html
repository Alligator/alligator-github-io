<h2>Making your own little world with fzf</h2>
Mar 22, 2023
<div class="blog-post">

  

  <p>In-between the interesting tasks like writing code or debugging, there's lots of little, routine
things to do. This post is about how I do these quicker with fzf.</p>
<h2 id="fzf">fzf?</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is a general purpose tool for picking a thing from a list of
things. It reads the list from stdin, and writes the selected item to stdout. What's in the list is
up to you, as is what you do with it.</p>
<p>Here's some ways I use it, in increasing complexity.</p>
<h2 id="level-1-sln-files">Level 1 - .sln files</h2><p>We have a monorepo containing lots of services, each of which has it's own .sln file. This tiny
script has saved me many minutes clicking around Windows explorer to open the .sln for a service:</p>
<aside>
<p>This example is in bash even though the original is a Windows batch script.</p>
<p>Batch scripts are just too weird to use for educational purposes.</p>
</aside><div class="hll"><pre><span></span>devenv<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">$(</span>fd<span class="w"> </span>-a<span class="w"> </span>.sln<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>fzf<span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a> to recursively find files ending in .sln, then fzf to pick
one, then opens that file in <code>devenv</code> (Visual Studio).</p>
<h2 id="level-2-recent-git-branches">Level 2 - Recent git branches</h2><p>This shows me a list of git branches, sorted by how recently I switched to them:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">current_branch</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>git<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span>--show-current<span class="k">)</span>

<span class="nv">ref</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>git<span class="w"> </span>reflog<span class="w"> </span>-1000<span class="w"> </span>--format<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;%cs %gs&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>rg<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;checkout: moving from&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>awk<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;!dupes[$5]++ { print $1, $5 }&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>fzf<span class="w"> </span>-n<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w"> </span>--header<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;current branch: </span><span class="nv">$current_branch</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>awk<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;{ print $2 }&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>

git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$ref</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This looks complicated, but most of it is plumbing to get the list of branches. It uses <code>git
reflog</code>, <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> and awk to get a list of branches and the
date they were last used, like this:</p>
<pre><code>2023-03-21 latest-branch
2023-03-14 old-branch
2023-01-12 older-branch
</code></pre>
<p>Which fzf then sorts alphabetically and shows from the bottom up, so you see the most recent branch
first. The <code>-n 2</code> flag tells fzf to search in the second field, i.e. the branch name.</p>
<p>Usually I want to switch to the most recent branch, which will be the default item selected. With
this script I can run it, quickly check if the branch is what I expected, and press enter to switch
to it.</p>
<h2 id="level-3-as-a-filter-in-a-larger-program">Level 3 - As a filter in a larger program</h2><p>We have lots of services with HTTP APIs and Swagger pages letting you poke at those
APIs. I often want to open a service's swagger page, but I don't know it's address.</p>
<p>I can get that information from an API, so I have python script like this:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># get the service names from an API</span>
<span class="n">fzf_input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s1">&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">service_names</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;fzf&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">fzf_input</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">capture_output</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">encoding</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;utf-8&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">returncode</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">returncode</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">selected_service_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stdout</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># look up the service address for the selected name</span>
<span class="c1"># and open it in a browser</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Shelling out to fzf is easy, especially in python since <code>subprocess.run</code> blocks until the program
exits. This script shows me a list of services, I pick one, and it's Swagger page opens in my
browser.</p>
<p>These are just some of the ways I use fzf to create my own little world of terminal utilities.</p>
<p>Speeding up these routine tasks isn't <em>really</em> about saving time. It's about staying focused and
avoiding distractions. Clicking around a slow UI or a file explorer is prime distraction time for
me.</p>
