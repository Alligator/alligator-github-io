<h2>fixing ls colours</h2>

  <p>A PSA for anyone who runs <code>ls</code> and is greeted with this legibility nightmare:</p>
<p><img src="green-ls.png" alt=""></p>
<p>According to dircolors, the green background represents a directory that is other-writable:</p>
<pre><code>$ dircolors -p | grep ";42"
STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 30;42 # dir that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
OTHER_WRITABLE 35;42 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
</code></pre>
<p>42, as part of an ANSI escape sequence, gives you a green background.</p>
<p>Luckily it's easy to change by appending some commands to the end of the <code>LS_COLORS</code> environment variable. Here's how I'm doing that in my bashrc:</p>
<pre><code>export LS_COLORS="${LS_COLORS}tw=01;34:ow=01;34:
</code></pre>
<p>This sets the tw (STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE) and ow (OTHER_WRITABLE) colors to the same as a regular directory; blue foreground with no background.</p>
<p>Also if you're curious, I tracked down <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2005-09/msg00023.html">the patch where those colours were introduced</a>.</p>
